[TL;DR](## "Be more pragmatic")

Setting: I was too broken and depressed because of being outcasted/ gatekeeped in my "friends" group @ 23TNT - HCMUS, he dragged me out for a reality check.

Some key things we discuss:
1. GDGoC community in University of Science.
2. Entrepreneurship in Vietnam
3. Higher studies vacancies globally.
4. The trap of academia, politics and bureaucracy.
 - Poverty awareness, culture barrier, politics unstability.
5. Outcasted and be hated on, what to do?
 - Maintain at least a relationship to keep your reality in check, preferably smart and self-oriented.
 - Optimize your brain to keep yourself up-to-date with courses materials.
 - Practice mindfulness and most importantly, the final phase of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and **acceptance**.
