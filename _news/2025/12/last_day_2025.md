To celebrate New Year's Eve, around 9 o'clock my roommates invited me to hangout in the central area. We took a metro and here's some of the moments I captured.

So I was wandering my thoughts, I pondered about what I had faced and done in 2025, together with whether if it could get better if I were to redo it all over again. Let's go through my mental status altogether shall we? <br><sub> warning: ranting ahead</sub>

Month:
1. I suffered from grinding for my GPA. I signed up for a bunch of bs-tier courses (obligatory for graduating) at my school. I broke up with my ex gf around this time. I started to get distant with my friends.
2. I enjoyed the Tet holiday but still couldn't stop myself from doing self destructive behaviours like procrastinating and not having any meaningful insights into Comp Neuro.
3. Came back to school and made a fuss altogether with my self-founded friend group. Dead
4. Starting to Dead, was doing a competition but that one also dropped out.
5. Slightly Dead, was doing Hopfield Network and struggle alot against communication across team members.
6. Dead, no one is by my side at this time of the year. I did every revision on the second semester alone. Beginning the first phases of grief: Denial, Anger, Bargaining.
7. Dead, mistreating myself mentally and physically. Alternating between intermediate phases of grief: Anger, Bargaining, Depression. Mostly Anger and Depression.
8. Dead, entering final phase of grief: Acceptance. Starting to open up to a bigger pool of connections beyond my current university.
9. Starting to recover and preparing for new semester.
10. Recovering and wandering around aimlessly.
11. Recovering and wandering around aimlessly.
12. Recovering and wandering around aimlessly.

$\Rightarrow \text{ }$ My problem is that I have my emotions and self-validation relying too much on external factors, I need to grow more independent, being able to provide myself with intrinsic gratification + feedback.
