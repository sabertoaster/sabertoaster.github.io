This semester I signed up for 5 courses at HCMUS. 
1. Computer Graphics (Prof Ly Quoc Ngoc)
2. Image and Video Processing (Prof Ly Quoc Ngoc)
3. AI Fundamentals (Prof Le Hoai Bac, TA Ngoc Duc & Hoai Nam)
4. Linux Operating System and Application (Lecturer Le Hoai Minh)
5. Operating System (Lecturer Ngoc Son)

Here's my impression on each one of those: 

> 1/ Computer Graphics (Prof Ly Quoc Ngoc)
> <br>
> 2/ Image and Video Processing (Prof Ly Quoc Ngoc)

I felt like I was trapped in the whole authoritarian idealism of research when I was 3 or 4 weeks in. I agree that the materials and ideas of his behind everything is accepted at a certain level. But the way he executed and expressed those information to us maybe a bit... outdated and out of touch as well, as most students can't grasp much of his details he conveyed.[^1]

Also the labs were vaguely specified af, I couldn't bother to put time into the work because I'm tired af right now with my research works already.

> 3/ AI Fundamentals (Prof Le Hoai Bac, TA Ngoc Duc & Hoai Nam)

Decent amount of work I would say, good amount of contents and Mr Bac is a very supportive professor as well. Cheers, mate!

> 4/ Linux Operating System and Application (Lecturer Le Hoai Minh)

Ordinary course I would say, except for the part that I have to finish my seminar on Firewalld by myself while signing up for it under a 2 people team is crazy.

> 5/ Operating System (Lecturer Ngoc Son)

Couldn't bother to understand this until the very last of days before exam lol. I'm getting my life wasted.
