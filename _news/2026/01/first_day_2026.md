<!-- to be written -->

10 rules to go by:
> 1. Am I solving Biological or Mental problem?
> 2. No inputs before outputs. [^2]
> 3. I don't need to be rich, I need to be useful.
> 4. Chaos is fuel, not the steering wheel.
> 5. Avoid the "zero task" shame.
> 6. Am I seeking connection or validation.
> 7. Respect personnel constraint.
> 8. Guild is a useless signal.
> 9. Is this thought statistically significant?
> 10. the secrete is endurance, not intensity.
