## Brief introduction
This is a course ran by Harvard, instructed by Professor [Pranav Rajpurkar](https://pranavrajpurkar.com/).
> Dive into cutting-edge development tools like PyTorch, Lightning, and Hugging Face, and streamline your workflow with VSCode, Git, and Conda. You'll learn how to harness the power of the cloud with AWS and Colab to train massive deep learning models with lightning-fast GPU acceleration. Plus, you'll master best practices for managing a large number of experiments with Weights and Biases. And that's just the beginning! This course will also teach you how to systematically read research papers, generate new ideas, and present them in slides or papers. You'll even learn valuable project management and team communication techniques used by top AI researchers. Don't miss out on this opportunity to level up your AI skills.

## Chapter 1 & 2: Introduction to AI and Setting up environment
Typical, intuitive guides to interact with AI and its research + development. Working environment requires source-code version control (Git), environment control (Conda) and editors (VSCode).

## [Chapter 3: Reading AI Research Papers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bPhwNdCCKkm1_adD0rx1YV6r2JG98qYmTxutT5gdAdQ/edit?tab=t.0)
### <u>Objectives</u>: 
- Conduct a literature search to identify papers relevant to a topic of interest
- Read a machine learning research paper and summarize its contributions

### <u>Chapter's content</u>:
TLDR: Read wide for learning, read deep for improving.
> I’m going to break down the process of reading AI research papers into two pieces: reading wide, and reading deep. *<span style="color:red">When you start learning about a new topic, you typically get more out of reading wide</span>*: this means navigating through literature reading small amounts of individual research papers. Our goal when reading wide is to build and improve our mental model of a research topic. *<span style="color:red">Once you have identified key works that you want to understand well in the first step, you will want to read deep</span>*: here, you are trying to read individual papers in depth. Both reading wide and deep are necessary and complimentary, especially when you’re getting started.

#### Read wide:
Paperswithcode (AI/ML) | Google scholar | ACM Digital Lib > Taking notes > Check benchmark with recent submissions > Check SOTA > Check dataset (in any order) > Read em and take notes. <br> Results: Notes condensed with information, may take up to 2-3 hours doing this.
> At this point, I find myself particularly intrigued by the SOTA methods: Why are they achieving high performance? According to the review paper, it looks like “training strategies using pre-training” have been an advance. Maybe that’s worth keeping an eye out for!

#### Read deep:
TLDR: Take incremental approach.
> So I would like you to take an incremental approach here. Understand that, in your first pass, you will not understand more than 10% of the research paper. The paper may require us to read another more fundamental paper (which might require reading a third paper and so on; it could be turtles all the way down)! Then, in your second pass, you might understand 20% of the paper. Understanding 100% of a paper might require a significant leap, maybe because it’s poorly written, insufficiently detailed, or simply too technically/mathematically advanced. We thus want to aim to build up to understanding as much of the paper as possible – I’ll bet that 70-80% of the paper is a good target.

Define your own highlight strategy, for example:
- The <span style="color:yellow">yellow highlights</span> are the problems/challenges
- The <span style="color:pink">pink highlights</span> are the solutions to the challenges
- The <span style="color:orange">orange highlights</span> are the main contributions of the work we’re reading.


### <u>Some useful tips</u>:
- Read deep: do a [three-pass approach](http://ccr.sigcomm.org/online/files/p83-keshavA.pdf). <br><br> First, take a quick scan through the title, put some brief thought into it. Read the abstract, introduction, section headings. **Identify the research question, the thematics, the papers' contribution.** Look through the figures for visual details. Glance through **discussion** if exists. Read the conclusion and see if the research question have been solved (?) <br><br> Second, focus on the introduction content, preliminary. Grasp the underlying content in **methodology** section and the **results**. Take notes on key points. Skip math terms if too heavy. The goal is to understand the paper's content without getting bogged down in details. <br><br> This pass is a thorough, line-by-line reading with the aim of understanding every detail and challenging the author's assumptions and claims. This pass is particularly useful for papers that require a deep understanding or are central. **Re-implement** the paper's work/ **identify areas for improvement**. 

- Read wide: If **doing a literature review/ search, just do the first pass** then look for referenced sources, mentioned SOTA methods, prominent proposed dataset/ benchmark, ...

- > You would have thus created a list of concepts you need to learn about, and the relevant paper for each, if the paper specifies any.
