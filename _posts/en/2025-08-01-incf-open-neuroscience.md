> Purpose of the study track is to provide a convenient and guided starting point to acquire the knowledge and skills required for open neuroscience.


## Brief introduction
{% details  Research in the neurosciences is becoming ever more demanding of a variety of sophisticated technical skills and computational competence, especially when one factors in the objective of making this science reproducible, open, and FAIR. %}
> In collaboration with the INCF, the Canadian Open Neuroscience Platform (CONP) is assembling a curated set of international content that aims to provide guidance through the increasingly complex landscape of skills and tools required for open neuroscience research.  Such initiatives are key to facilitating the acquisition of the skills and knowledge comprising open-science workflows (from ‘open-by-design’ experimental conception, through reproducible analysis, to safe data sharing).  This is a living collection, with many materials to be added and updated still.
<br>
> The CONP is funded by a Brain Canada Platform Support Grant Competition Award, as well as funds and in-kind support from sponsor organizations.  Please visit the [CONP](https://conp.ca/) and [Brain Canada](https://braincanada.ca/) websites linked below for more information.

The track is divided into 3 seperate parts: 
- [Data Science - Tools of the Trade](https://training.incf.org/collection/data-science-tools-trade): <br> This collection looks to introduce neuroscience trainees to many of the basic tools and techniques essential for most computationally intensive neuroscience research environments.
- [Techniques on Statistics and Machine Learning](https://training.incf.org/collection/statistics-machine-learning): <br> These courses will introduce the basics of powerful machine learning techniques and the elements of traditional statistical approaches provide foundational knowledge for multivariate analyses.
- [Standard & Best Practices](https://training.incf.org/collection/standards-best-practices): <br> This collection of courses and lessons intends to provide resources for standards and best practices in Open Science, Publishing, Ethics, and more.
