## Context
{% details Story behind this post %}
I was at a weekly climbing event, then my seniors (Yang and Soybean) asked if I knew Fourier Transform. I was quite intrigued since I had heard about it a few times before (in the context of defactorizing wave signals into combination of sin and cos functions) and also, we're from a computer scientist (at which I thought this domain of knowledge is for mechanical engineering/ other types of engineering only). It's a tragedy we ain't learning this in HCMUS curriculum in prior to year 3. That's why I want to challenge myself by doing a write-up about Fourier Transform, and its FFT variant on my blog.
{% enddetails %}

In this blog post I'm gonna cover through Fourier Transform and its FFT variant with some essence on Convolution/ Kernel/ Filter algorithms as well.
