Day 1: Neuron Fundamentals and Statistical Parallels
Topic: Neuron Architecture (Dendrites, Soma, Axon) and the Statistical Perceptron
Description: Compare biological neuron structure with the statistical perceptron model. Explore how dendrites correspond to inputs, soma to weighted summation, and axon to output activation.
Demo: Interactive visualization comparing biological neurons and perceptron models with adjustable weights and activation thresholds, implementing both a biological neuron simulator and statistical perceptron.
