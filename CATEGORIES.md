### General
*Broad, high-level categories for filtering.*
*   `artificial-intelligence`
*   `computational-neuroscience`
*   `machine-learning`
*   `deep-learning`
*   `mathematics`
*   `computer-science`

### Specified
*Technical niches you frequently discuss or research.*

**NeuroAI & Brain Dynamics**
*   `spiking-neural-networks` (for your work with SNNs/STDP)
*   `brain-encoding` (for fMRI encoding models and alignment)
*   `cognitive-modeling` (Marr’s levels, top-down theories)
*   `biocomputing` (FinalSpark, wetware computing)
*   `neural-dynamics`

**Engineering & Tools**
*   `qt-framework` (C++ dev)
*   `cpp`
*   `python`
*   `latex` (academic writing)
*   `self-hosting` (homelab/server management)

**Research**
*   `paper-review`
*   `conference-notes` (CCN, NeurIPS, etc.)
*   `research-methodology`

### Outside
*Personal context, hobbies, and "locking in."*
*   `undergrad-life` (university experiences in Vietnam)
*   `rant` (unfiltered thoughts)
*   `aquarium` (hobby updates)
*   `hardware-salvaging`
*   `productivity` (tips to lock in/study hacks)
*   `project-log` (devlogs for ongoing builds)

### **Suggested Tagging Strategy**
1.  **Hierarchy Rule:** Always use at least one **General** tag + one **Specified** tag per technical post.
    *   *Example:* A post about an SNN implementation would be: `artificial-intelligence`, `spiking-neural-networks`, `python`.
2.  **Series Tag:** If you write a multi-part breakdown (e.g., on Marr's Levels), create a temporary "series" tag like `neuroai-roadmap-2026`.
3.  **Language:** Since you create content in Vietnamese too, consider a `tieng-viet` tag if the blog is bilingual, or stick to English tags for consistency.
